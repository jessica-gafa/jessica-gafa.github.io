  <h2>My Professional History and Skills</h2>
  <p>
    I have developed strong teaching, communication, and organisational skills through a range of professional and volunteer roles in education. I currently work as an Out of School Hours (OOSH) educator at Metella Road Out of School Hours Child Care, where I support primary school children aged 4 to 12. This role has strengthened my ability to build positive relationships, manage diverse behaviours, and create inclusive learning environments that encourage curiosity and growth.</p>

    <p>In addition, I work as a Mathematics Tutor with Innovative Mathematics, supporting secondary students, including those studying Standard Mathematics. Tutoring has refined my ability to explain challenging concepts clearly and adapt my approach to meet the individual needs of each learner.</p>

    <p> an Associate Teacher within the Catholic Schools Parramatta Diocese (CSPD), I have gained practical classroom experience by assisting with lesson delivery, student support, and resource preparation. These experiences have deepened my understanding of curriculum implementation, assessment, and professional collaboration within school communities.</p>

    <p> my studies at the Australian Catholic University (ACU), I am completing a Bachelor of Education/Bachelor of Arts in Secondary Education (Mathematics). My coursework has included Databases and SQL, Digital Technologies, and Mathematics Pedagogy, giving me the technical and analytical skills to integrate digital learning tools effectively into teaching practice.</p>

    <p>I am confident in:
        <ul>
            <li>Designing engaging and differentiated lessons that connect mathematics to real-world contexts.</li>
            <li>Integrating technology and coding (Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL) to enhance learning.</li>
            <li>Managing classrooms and supporting positive student behaviour.</li>
            <li>Building strong relationships with students, colleagues, and families.</li>
            <li>Working collaboratively as part of a professional learning community.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>These experiences have shaped me into a reflective and adaptable educator who values curiosity, creativity, and connection in every learning environment.</p>
