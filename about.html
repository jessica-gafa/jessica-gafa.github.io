            <h2>My Life Outside The Classroom:</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Outside the classroom, I’m someone who finds creativity and calm in the little things. Whether I’m playing the drums, crocheting, or coding, I love learning through exploration and self-expression. Music has always been a big part of my life. I’ve taken drum lessons for several years and enjoy experimenting with rhythm and sound. Crocheting gives me a chance to slow down and create something tangible, while coding allows me to blend my logical and creative sides, building small projects that make learning more engaging and interactive.</p>

          <p>When I’m not studying or creating, you’ll probably find me spending time with my whippet, Rusty, my little bundle of chaos and comfort. He has a big personality for such a small dog and constantly reminds me to stay playful, patient and curious (traits that I think every good teacher needs).</p>

          <p>I’ve always been drawn to mathematics because of the way it connects logic and creativity. To me, maths isn’t just about numbers, it’s about patterns, problem-solving, and finding beauty in structure. Pairing it with Digital Technologies has allowed me to explore how innovation and data can transform the classroom, making learning more accessible and exciting for students.</p>

          <p>I strive to bring this mindset into everything I do, both personally and professionally. Whether it’s perfecting a drum pattern, debugging a bit of code, or helping a student grasp a challenging concept, I see learning as a lifelong journey built on curiosity, compassion, and perseverance.</p>
        
          <h2>My Goals</h2>
          <p>As I continue to grow as a pre-service teacher, my goal is to create a classroom environment where every student feels seen, supported, and inspired to learn. I want to build lessons that make mathematics meaningful, not just through numbers and equations but through curiosity, creativity, and connection.</p>

          <p>I am passionate about exploring ways to integrate digital technologies into teaching, helping students engage with problem-solving in new and interactive ways. By combining logic with creativity, I aim to make learning both accessible and exciting, empowering students to see themselves as capable mathematicians and thinkers. </p>

          <p>Beyond the classroom, I aspire to keep learning through collaboration with colleagues, professional development, and reflection on my own practice. I want to continually grow not only as a teacher but as a person who models resilience, empathy, and curiosity. </p>

          <p>In the future, I hope to contribute to a school community that values inclusion, wellbeing, and lifelong learning. My ultimate goal is simple: to help every student believe they are capable of success and to find joy in discovering their own potential.</p>
