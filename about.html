    <!--About my work-->
    <h2>My work experience:</h2>
    <p>My work experience includes being an educator at an afterschool care program, tutoring numerous secondary students in mathematics, and working as an associate teacher within the Parramatta Catholic Diocese. Through these roles, I have developed many of the essential skills required to be an effective high school teacher. These include patience, strong time management, adaptability, clear communication, and the ability to build meaningful relationships with students. I have learned how to support diverse learning needs, maintain a safe and engaging classroom environment, and collaborate with colleagues and families to promote student growth. These experiences have deepened my passion for teaching and further prepared me for the responsibilities of a high school educator.</p>
