            <p>I believe that behaviour is a form of communication and that every behaviour happens for a reason. Rather than viewing challenging behaviour as something to simply stop, I see it as an opportunity to understand what a student is experiencing and what support they may need. My approach begins with identifying the underlying causes, whether they are social, emotional, academic, or environmental.</p>

            <p>By building positive relationships and creating a safe and respectful classroom environment, I aim to prevent many issues before they arise. When challenges do occur, I focus on restorative conversations, consistency, and strategies that teach self regulation rather than punishment. This allows students to feel heard, supported, and guided toward making better choices in the future.</p>

            <p>My goal is to help students develop the skills they need to manage their own behaviour, while also maintaining a classroom culture that is calm, inclusive, and focused on learning.</p>
